[![Build Status](https://snap-ci.com/ligi/TwitterBot/branch/master/build_image)](https://snap-ci.com/ligi/TwitterBot/branch/master)

a TwitterBot written in Kotlin

What do I do:

 - answer to tweets from certain account with predefined answers
 - answer to retweeters
 - retweet tweets of certain accounts

How do I try to not show I am a bot: 

 - act slowly
 - randomized timing
 - sleep cycles ( TODO )
 - variance in what I say
 - try to correlate answer to tweet ( TODO )
